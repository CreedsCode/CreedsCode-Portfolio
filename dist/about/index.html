                <p>I am Dercio 17 years old living in a town located in Germany, between Cologne and Aachen. <br/> Besides, done with the 10th class after summer and enjoying my future with an internship. See what the future brings... <br/> ...currently nothing more than ghosting and declines. But I have my goal set, so ain't time to rest. <br/>
                    Also I kept to dedicate my free time with programming, a month ago I were learning about how to apply programming architectures and how to keep code "DRY", neverless my code didn't changed much on the dry part, maybe a bit. <br/>
                    Currently, I am trying a lot out with C# and the web framework Asp.net in combination with VueJs and Identity. It's time to build something from that knowledge, so you get something to see! With the summer holidays next door, I see forward to make something overcomplicated because why not. Or proceed with my other pet projects, sounds like something for the future for now. ðŸ¤ž
